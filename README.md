# Personalized Health and Wellness Recommendation System

![Project Logo](insert_logo_image_url_here)

## Project Description

In this innovative project, we have developed a backend-only Personalized Health and Wellness Recommendation System using Microservices, Spring Boot, JPA, API Gateway, Discovery Server, and Authentication Service. The system aims to provide users with tailored health and wellness recommendations, facilitate progress tracking, encourage community engagement, offer nutrition information, support mental health, utilize data analytics, and provide feedback analysis. This comprehensive platform empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

## Key Features and Components

### Microservices Architecture

The system employs a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Each microservice addresses specific aspects of health and wellness recommendations and data management.

### Spring Boot

Spring Boot serves as the foundational framework for developing microservices. Its capabilities expedite the creation of robust and scalable back-end services.

### JPA (Java Persistence API)

JPA facilitates data persistence and interaction with a relational database. Entities representing user profiles, health data, recommendations, feedback, and community interactions are defined and managed using JPA.

### API Gateway

An API Gateway centralizes request routing, security, and authentication. It ensures a unified and secure API surface for client interactions.

### Discovery Server

The Discovery Server manages service registration and discovery for microservices. It enables dynamic scaling and load balancing, ensuring system reliability.

### Authentication Service

The Authentication Service handles user registration, login, and session management. Secure user authentication and access token generation are implemented.

### PostgreSQL Database

Security, User, and Recommendation microservices use PostgreSQL as the database for enhanced data security and reliability.

### MySQL Database

Other microservices utilize MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### WebClient and Auto-trigger Retry Mechanism

Microservices communicate with each other using WebClient, enabling efficient microservice-to-microservice communication. An auto-trigger retry mechanism ensures data consistency.

### Circuit Breaker and Fallback Methods

The system incorporates a circuit breaker and fallback methods to enhance fault tolerance and resilience.
